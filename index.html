            <br>
            <p>Our speech and debate camp will be geared towards students in 3rd to 7th grade.</p>
            <p>Each student will learn skills in public speaking, critical thinking, and research.</p>
            <p>Each session will be one hour, with optional office hours after, and will occur three times a week: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This camp will run from July 1st to 26th. Depending on the availability of the kids, camp sessions will either be in the morning (10:30 AM - 11:30 AM) or in the afternoon (4:30 PM - 5:30 PM). Optional office hours can be scheduled by the parent or kid and will take place for thirty minutes after the camp session. </p>
            <p>In order to ensure the commitment of the students, we are charging a $40.00 fee. If the student is present at every class (running from July 1st to July 26th), this fee will be refunded. Parents must notify coaches ahead of time for exceptions.</p>

            <p>This camp will be led by Deepika Sujay and Hannah Ying, two passionate high schoolers with 6 years of combined speech and debate experience. Having competed at both middle school and high school levels, we are eager to share their knowledge and enthusiasm with the next generation of leaders. Join us for an exciting opportunity to explore the world of speech and debate!</p>
